Retail store analytics
Shopping Experience AI Analysis System is a leading retail analytics venture
changing the manner Indian retailers monitor and maximize in-store customer
behaviour. By capitalizing on the power of Artificial Intelligence and current
CCTV infrastructure, we provide real-time, data-based insights to optimize
customer engagement, layout optimization, and sales performance.
Established by a group of data scientists, retail strategists, and tech experts, we
aim to fill the gap between physical retail and intelligent decision-making.
Conventional retail practices heavily depend on guesswork, manual observation,
or stale data. We turn it around by translating raw CCTV video into actionable
behavioral insights—heatmaps, dwell times, product interaction, and movement
patterns—all while maintaining privacy compliance.
Our cloud-based platform is a scalable, flexible SaaS model, plus customized
consulting, data licensing, and value-added services such as staff training and
campaign optimization. From one local retail store or a national retailer chain,
our scalable solution helps retailers make faster, smarter, and more profitable
decisions.
Track-a-Lakshmi is positioned to revolutionize the retail analytics space by
leveraging artificial intelligence and existing CCTV infrastructure. Our AIpowered system converts video footage into actionable behavioral data that
helps store owners make smarter decisions about store layout, staffing,
promotions, and inventory placement. The system delivers insights like footfall
tracking, heatmaps, dwell time, and product engagement metrics, providing a
comprehensive view of customer interaction within the store.
In an industry where the competition is tough and customer experience matters
most, we enable Indian retailers to outpace—doing more than just selling more
but selling smarter.
